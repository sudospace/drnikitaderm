                        <h2>My Approach</h2>
                        <p>My approach to dermatology is patient-oriented. I don't believe in treating everyone using the same template or protocol. Every patient and every condition is different, and treatment should reflect that.</p>
                        <p>I believe strongly in evidence-based medicine. My decisions are guided by scientific research along with clinical experience. For me, treatment is not only about improving appearance, but about managing the disease effectively and responsibly.</p>
                        <p>I also see the skin as a mirror of internal health. Many skin conditions are influenced by systemic, metabolic, immunological, and lifestyle factors. Because of this, I prefer to look beyond symptoms and address contributing factors wherever possible, rather than offering only short-term fixes.</p>
                        <p>I give equal importance to both aesthetic and clinical dermatology. Along with aesthetic care, my practice focuses on diagnosing and managing chronic skin diseases, inflammatory conditions, infections, and disorders of pigmentation and immunity.</p>

                        <p>I manage a wide range of skin conditions, including acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, and skin infections. Each condition is approached with a clear diagnosis and an understanding of what may be triggering or sustaining it. Treatment is planned individually, based on the condition, its severity, and the patient's overall health and lifestyle.</p>
