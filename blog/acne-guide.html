                    </div>

                        <p>Acne is one of the most common skin problems faced by everyone once or more than once in a lifetime. Depending on the severity, it can cause emotional distress along with complications like scars and pigmentation. Prompt evaluation and treatment is necessary for this condition.</p>

                        <h2>What is Acne?</h2>
                        <p>Commonly called pimples, acne mostly occurs over the face, chest, back, and shoulders. It is inflammation and infection which occurs in the pilosebaceous glands of the skin, commonly called oil glands.</p>

                        <h2>Why Does Acne Occur?</h2>
                        <p>Acne develops due to a combination of different factors:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Excess oil (sebum) production</li>
                            <li>Blocked opening of oil glands</li>
                            <li>Excessive bacterial growth</li>
                            <li>Excess androgens</li>

                        </ol>

                        <h2>Not All Acne is the Same: Know Your Type</h2>
                        <p><strong>Comedonal Acne</strong> – Early stage of acne with blackheads and whiteheads</p>

                        <h2>Signs It's Time to See a Dermatologist</h2>

                        <h2>Treatment Options for Acne</h2>
                        <p>Acne treatment depends on the type and severity of acne, skin type, and individual triggers. Mild acne is usually managed with topical creams and gels that help unclog pores, reduce bacteria, and control oil production. Moderate to severe acne may require oral medications, including antibiotics or hormonal therapy, prescribed under medical supervision. In resistant or severe cases, advanced treatments with in-clinic procedures may be advised.</p>
                        <p>Early and consistent treatment not only improves active acne but also helps prevent scarring and long-term pigmentation.</p>

                        <p>If you're struggling with acne, schedule a consultation to discuss a personalized treatment plan for your skin.</p>
